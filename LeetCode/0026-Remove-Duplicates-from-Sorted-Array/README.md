## 📝 Problem Description

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Consider the number of unique elements in&nbsp;nums to be k​​​​​​​​​​​​​​. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements&nbsp;k.

The first&nbsp;k&nbsp;elements of&nbsp;nums&nbsp;should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index&nbsp;k - 1&nbsp;can be ignored.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

&nbsp;
Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
	-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
	nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
